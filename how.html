        <h1>How can you use a 40% keyboard?</h1>

        <p>
            Looking at r/mechanical keyboards, you may see a 40% keyboard and wonder <em>"How do people use this? its missing basic things like the number row and arrow keys! This has gotta be a meme."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the use of QMK firmware—the firmware that most custom keyboards rely on—40% percent keyboards can be as or even more functional than a standard 100% keyboard. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Although some 40% keyboards look very similar to a 60% keyboard, excluding the deticated number row, caps lock, and a \| key, there are some that are even smaller, and forgo dedicated modifier keys.  
        </p>

        <p>
            One better known example of a sub-40% keyboard is the QAZ, a 35% keyboard. Most users gain functionality of modifiers by using a combination of QMK's tap dance and combo functionality. Tap dance enables a key to act as another when tapped, held, or double tapped. Combos enable two or more keys to act as a different key.

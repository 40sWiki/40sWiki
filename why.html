        <h1>Why use a 40% keyboard?</h1>

        <p>
            Looking at r/mechanical keyboards, you may see a 40% keyboard and wonder <em>"Why do people use this? its missing basic things like the number row and arrow keys! This has gotta be a meme."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            The truth is, there are a variety of reasons why someone might use a 40% keyboard but the most basic and common reasons why someone might use a 40% are:
            <ul>
                <li>40% keyboards are smaller than other keyboards; they take up less desk space that can be used for other things, like your mouse, notebook, or cat.</li>
                <li>40% keyboards require less travel to get to every key. On a 40% keyboard you generally will not have to move your hands from where they are resting to access a key like the arrow keys or numrow.</li>
                <li>Another list item</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
